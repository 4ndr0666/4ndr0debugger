*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (via CDN)
*   **AI:** Google Gemini API (`@google/genai`)
*   **Build/Dev:** Vite
*   **Syntax Highlighting:** highlight.js

## Prerequisites

*   A modern web browser.
*   A Google Gemini API Key. You can obtain one from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

## Setup and Running

This project uses Vite for development.

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Configure Gemini API Key**
    The application requires a Gemini API key. Create a `.env` file in the root of the project:
    ```
    GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"
    ```
    Replace `YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual key. The Vite configuration in `vite.config.ts` will make this key available to the application.

4.  **Run the Development Server**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The application will be available at the local URL provided by Vite (usually `http://localhost:5173`).

## How to Use

1.  **Open the App:** Navigate to the local URL after starting the dev server.
2.  **Select a Mode:** Use the hamburger menu in the top-left to choose.
3.  **Input Code:** Paste your code into the appropriate editor panel(s).
4.  **Configure & Submit:** Select the language and an optional review profile, then click the available options.
5.  **View Feedback:** The input panel will collapse, and the AI's analysis will stream into the output panel.
6.  **Use Post-Review Tools:** After a review, buttons will appear for several operations.
7.  **Manage Versions:** Use the "Versioning" option in the menu to access your saved reviews.
8.  **Session Management:** Use the import/export icons in the header to save or load your work.
