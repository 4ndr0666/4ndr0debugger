# 4ndr0⫌ebugger (AI Code Reviewer)

Welcome to 4ndr0⫌ebugger! This application leverages the power of Google's Gemini API, specifically the `gemini-2.5-flash` model, to provide intelligent analysis and feedback on your code. Submit code snippets in various languages, and the AI will help you identify potential bugs, suggest improvements for quality and style, and offer insights based on best practices, aiming to guide you towards production-ready revisions.

The application features a sleek, futuristic HUD (Heads-Up Display) inspired UI theme with glowing cyan elements on a black background.

## Features

*   **AI-Powered Code Analysis & Feedback:** Get detailed feedback on code quality, bugs, style, and potential improvements using the Gemini API.
*   **Multiple Language Support:** Review code in JavaScript, Python, Java, C#, Shell Script, and many more, each with tailored review criteria.
*   **Customizable Review Profiles:** Focus the AI's analysis on specific areas like Security, Performance, Modularity, or provide your own custom instructions.
*   **Comparative Analysis:** Submit two versions of a codebase and a shared goal to receive a single, optimized and merged version.
*   **Contextual Actions:**
    *   **Selection-Based Review:** Highlight code in the editor to trigger specific actions like "Explain Selection" or "Review Selection".
    *   **Follow-up Chat:** After receiving a review, use the "Follow-up" button to open a chat interface to ask questions about the feedback.
    *   **Unit Test & Docs Generation:** Automatically generate unit tests or documentation for your code.
    *   **Commit Message Generation:** After a review results in changes, automatically generate a conventional commit message based on the diff.
*   **Streaming Responses:** All API interactions are streamed, meaning you see feedback as it's being generated by the AI.
*   **Versioning & Session Management:**
    *   Save, load, and delete named versions of your reviews.
    *   Import and Export your entire session (code, history, saved versions) to a JSON file.
*   **Modern UI/UX:**
    *   A unique, futuristic HUD dark theme.
    *   Input panel collapses for a focused view during analysis.
    *   Command palette menu for easy access to all features.
    *   Responsive design for various screen sizes.
    *   API Key Status Banner to inform the user if the key is missing.

## Tech Stack

*   **Frontend:** React, TypeScript
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (via CDN)
*   **AI:** Google Gemini API (`@google/genai`)
*   **Build/Dev:** Vite
*   **Syntax Highlighting:** highlight.js

## Prerequisites

*   A modern web browser.
*   A Google Gemini API Key. You can obtain one from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

## Setup and Running

This project uses Vite for development.

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Configure Gemini API Key**
    The application requires a Gemini API key. Create a `.env` file in the root of the project:
    ```
    GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"
    ```
    Replace `YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual key. The Vite configuration in `vite.config.ts` will make this key available to the application.

4.  **Run the Development Server**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The application will be available at the local URL provided by Vite (usually `http://localhost:5173`).

## How to Use

1.  **Open the App:** Navigate to the local URL after starting the dev server.
2.  **Select a Mode:** Use the hamburger menu in the top-left to choose between "Single Code Review" or "Comparative Analysis".
3.  **Input Code:** Paste your code into the appropriate editor panel(s).
4.  **Configure & Submit:** Select the language and an optional review profile, then click the "Review Code" or "Compare & Optimize" button.
5.  **View Feedback:** The input panel will collapse, and the AI's analysis will stream into the output panel.
6.  **Use Post-Review Tools:** After a review, buttons will appear for "Show Diff," "Generate Commit," "Follow-up," and "Save Version."
7.  **Manage Versions:** Use the "Versioning" option in the menu to access your saved reviews.
8.  **Session Management:** Use the import/export icons in the header to save or load your work.


## Future Enhancements

This is a list of potential features and improvements for future development:

*   **Interactive Annotations**: Imagine if, instead of just reading the feedback, the AI's suggestions appeared as annotations directly inside the code editor. A highlight on a specific line could pop up a suggestion from the AI.
*   **One-Click Code Patching**: Taking the above idea further, each suggestion could have an "Accept" button. Clicking it would instantly apply the AI's suggested code change to the editor. This would transform the review process from a manual copy-paste task into a seamless, interactive dialogue.
*   **Multi-File Context Analysis:** Allow the user to upload or reference multiple files from a project. When reviewing one file, the AI would have the context of the others, enabling it to understand cross-file dependencies, function calls, and type definitions for more accurate and insightful reviews.
