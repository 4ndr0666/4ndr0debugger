# 4ndr0⫌ebugger (AI Code Reviewer)

Welcome to 4ndr0⫌ebugger! This application leverages the power of Google's Gemini API, specifically the \`gemini-2.5-pro\` model, to provide intelligent analysis and feedback on your code. Submit code snippets in various languages, and the AI will help you identify potential bugs, suggest improvements for quality and style, and offer insights based on best practices, aiming to guide you towards production-ready revisions.

The application features a sleek, cyan-centric and cyberpunk-inspired UI theme I call "electric glass".

## Features

*   **AI-Powered Code Analysis & Feedback:** Get detailed feedback on code quality, bugs, style, and potential improvements using the Gemini API. For some languages, like Shell Script, the AI is prompted for a complete revision.
*   **Follow-up Chat:** After receiving a review, use the "Follow-up" button to open a chat interface. This allows you to ask the AI questions about its feedback, maintaining the context of the original code and review for a persistent conversation.
*   **Multiple Language Support:** Review code in JavaScript, Python, Java, C#, Shell Script, and many more, each with tailored review criteria.
*   **Structured Feedback:** AI responses are formatted in markdown for clear readability, including code block examples.
*   **Dynamic Language-Specific Templates:** Input your code into a predefined, language-specific template. This provides context to the AI for more targeted reviews based on established guidelines for each language.
*   **Customizable AI Behavior:** The underlying system instructions and language-specific review criteria for the AI can be modified (see `constants.ts`).
*   **Responsive Design:** User interface adapts to various screen sizes.
*   **Thematic UI:** My unique "electric glass" dark theme provides a visually appealing experience.
*   **API Key Status Banner:** Informs the user if the Gemini API key is configured.

## Tech Stack

*   **Frontend:** React 19, TypeScript
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (via CDN)
*   **AI:** Google Gemini API (`@google/genai`)
*   **Module Loading:** ES Modules via `esm.sh` for direct browser imports.

## Prerequisites

*   A modern web browser.
*   A Google Gemini API Key. You can obtain one from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

## Setup and Installation

This project is designed to be run directly in a browser without a complex build step, thanks to CDN-hosted libraries and ES module imports.

### 1. Clone the Repository (or Download Files)

If you've cloned a repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
```
If you have the files directly, ensure they are in a single directory.

### 2. Configure Gemini API Key

The application requires a Gemini API key to function. It expects this key to be available as `process.env.API_KEY`. Since this is a frontend application running directly in the browser without a Node.js backend or a typical build process that injects environment variables, you need to make this key available to the browser environment.

**The recommended method for this setup is to add a script tag in `index.html` before the main application script:**

1.  Open `index.html`.
2.  Locate the `<head>` section.
3.  Before the closing `</head>` tag or just before the `<script type="module" src="/index.tsx"></script>` line in the `<body>`, add the following script block, replacing `"YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"` with your actual API key:

    ```html
    <script>
      window.process = {
        env: {
          API_KEY: "YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"
        }
      };
    </script>
    ```

    **Example placement in `index.html` (within `<head>`):**
    ```html
    <head>
      <meta charset="UTF-8" />
      <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
      <title>AI Code Reviewer</title>
      <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
      <style>
        /* ... existing styles ... */
      </style>
      <script>
        window.process = {
          env: {
            API_KEY: "YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY" // <--- REPLACE THIS WITH YOUR ACTUAL KEY
          }
        };
      </script>
      <script type="importmap">
      {
        "imports": {
          "react/": "https://esm.sh/react@^19.1.0/",
          "react": "https://esm.sh/react@^19.1.0",
          "@google/genai": "https://esm.sh/@google/genai@^1.0.1",
          "react-dom/": "https://esm.sh/react-dom@^19.1.0/"
        }
      }
      </script>
    </head>
    ```

    **Security Note:** Be mindful that embedding API keys directly in client-side code is generally not recommended for production applications that will be publicly hosted, as it exposes the key. For personal use or development, this method is straightforward. For public deployment, consider using a backend proxy or serverless function to manage API calls.

## Running the Application

Once the API key is configured in `index.html`:

1.  Open the `index.html` file directly in your web browser.
    *   You can usually do this by double-clicking the file or right-clicking and choosing "Open with" your preferred browser.
    *   Alternatively, you can serve the directory using a simple HTTP server (e.g., `npx serve` or Python's `http.server`) if you encounter issues with ES module loading directly from the file system, although modern browsers are generally good with `file:///` paths for ES modules.

The application should now load, and the API Key banner should indicate that the key is configured (or show an error if it's still not detected or invalid).

## How to Use

1.  **Select Language:** Choose the programming language of the code you want to review from the "Select Language" dropdown. This will also load language-specific review criteria into the input template.
2.  **Paste Code:** The input area provides a template. Paste your code snippet into the section marked `PASTE CODE HERE` within the pre-filled template. The rest of the template provides language-specific instructions and context to the Gemini AI model.
3.  **Submit for Review:** Click the "Review Code" button.
4.  **View Feedback:** The AI's review will appear in the "Review Feedback" panel. This panel will show a loading indicator while the AI processes your request. Any errors during the API call will also be displayed here.
5.  **Ask a Follow-up:** After a review is complete, click the "Follow-up" button. The code editor will be replaced by a chat window where you can ask questions about the review. The review panel on the right will update with the latest answer. Click "New Review" to exit the chat and start over.

## Code Input Template

The application uses language-specific templates for code input. The structure for these templates is dynamically generated by the `generateReviewerTemplate` function in `constants.ts`. This function incorporates:
*   Code fences (e.g., \`\`\`javascript ... \`\`\`) appropriate for the selected language, with a `PASTE CODE HERE` marker for your code.
*   A "## Summary for [Language]" section with detailed, language-specific instructions and criteria for the AI reviewer, sourced from `LANGUAGE_SPECIFIC_INSTRUCTIONS` in `constants.ts`.

Pasting your code within this template helps guide the Gemini model to provide more relevant and comprehensive feedback according to the established guidelines for each language.

## Customization

You can customize various aspects of the AI's behavior:

### Gemini Model and Prompts

*   **Model:** The Gemini model used is `gemini-2.5-pro`, defined in `constants.ts` (`GEMINI_MODEL_NAME`). You can change this to other compatible models if needed.
*   **System Instruction:** The high-level instruction given to the AI is defined in `constants.ts` (`SYSTEM_INSTRUCTION`).
*   **Language-Specific Instructions:** The detailed review criteria and the prompt structure for each language are defined in `LANGUAGE_SPECIFIC_INSTRUCTIONS` and the `generateReviewerTemplate` function within `constants.ts`.

### Supported Languages

*   The list of supported languages for the dropdown is defined in `constants.ts` (`SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES`).
*   The mapping of these languages to markdown tags (for code block formatting) is in `constants.ts` (`LANGUAGE_TAG_MAP`). You can extend these lists to support more languages.
